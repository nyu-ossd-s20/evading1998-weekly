## We are working on a browser extention

### What we want
The main idea of our extension is to make people's life easier. When we are downloading files, they automatically go to a folder called download. We are trying to build an extension that puts the files into specific folders according to their extensions. For example, a jpg file would be automatically put into a jpg file. 

### Procedure and possible challenges
We are using github to create our extension as an open source project. I have made the readme file and added license in our repository.

I would imagine that there are cases where the extension is not a current folder presented in the user's system. In that case, we need to make a folder for the new extension. I am a little concerned with our permission to create new folders for our users. We would need to figure that out. 

Through the process of trying out the extensions on firefox, I became more farmiliar with the structure and process of building and adding an extension to a browser. In class on Monday, I discovered that an extension can be very simple or complex, and the codes are similar with creating a webpage. So javascript, html and css would come in handy when we are building our own extensions. The only confusing part for me now is the purpose of the manifest json file, but I believe that I will be able to see its function soon.
