title: "Week 4: Open Data and more"

## Besides code, what else is open-sourced?
### Data
In Wednesday's lecture, Deena and Vicky gave an overview of open source data from different perspectives, and I find it very helpful. Since I have not done any research previous, I have limited knowledge of data and databases. However, I have worked at a small investment company, where I manage their website by connecting their database to the [SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/) database. This is a huge database, where US companies file their financial reports. I know how powerful the files are, as they contain all the information about the market. And the database is open-sourced, so anyone with an interest in finance, or professional analyst have the exact same access to the data

While I manage the website, I did encounter some difficulties processing the data: one of the searches in the website was extremely slow. I went in to explore the issue, and the reason that it is taking a long time to process the data is because the search is not an exact match. the Query has to go through the entire column to find all the patterns. I fixed it by first formatting the columns. Then, I just perform an exact match, and things did speed up.
