## Aspects to consider about Open Source Projects
### Research and Data
Vicky provided much information on the reproducibility of researches today in class, and I can see how open sourced projects play a big role in the topic. It first is very helpful in terms of preserving the data used in the research. Second, if the documentation is well-written, it is a lot easier for other to redo the research process. Vicky mentions that almost all research, when performed by someone else, will lead to different results. For example, only 30% of psychology research are going to yield the exact results. 

### OS platform and functions
Having an open sourced platform to store the data and methods of research is also very important. Vicky mentions that GitLab and CI are hosting platforms to check the open code for researches. The importance of using the correct license is also stressed in Vickyâ€™s speech, she even provided an open-sourced website to find the most appropriate license for a project. I think I would be using that in the future. 

### Reproducibility
Last but not least, Vicky mentions that she starts contributing via helping with documentations, which is a very direct and get-involved-easily way to contribute to a project. Though it does not require writing any code, writing documentations still provides a crucial function for the open-source projects, but in terms of its functionality and reproducibility in the future. I think this is a good suggestion to keep in mind when I find some open source project that interests me.
